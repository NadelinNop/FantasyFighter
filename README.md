# FantasyFighter
A local player1 versus player2 game, where each players have a variety of fighters to pick from and fight each other.

Each player will get their own turn to pick their fighter. After that their selected characters will spawn in a new place to combat. Player 1 will be using the WASD keys to move and attack, whereas player 2 will be using the arrow keys. The players will then have to battle to the death and the remaining player will win. 

#This is a project made to fully demonstrate the four principles of OOP. I have also fully made use of Sprites to create animation for each movements and attacks of the characters.
