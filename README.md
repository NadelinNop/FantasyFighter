Each player will get their own turn to pick their fighter. After that their selected characters will spawn in a new place to combat. Player 1 will be using the WASD keys to move and attack, whereas player 2 will be using the arrow keys. The players will then have to battle to the death and the remaining player will win. 

#This is a project made to fully demonstrate the four principles of OOP. I have also fully made use of Sprites to create animation for each movements and attacks of the characters.

This sequence diagram shows a snippet on how the gui interaction can lead to the creation of characters depending also on whether player 1 is selecting or player 2.
